# RFID-Attendance-Based-System
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses radio waves to identify objects or individuals. Each RFID tag contains a unique identifier which can be read wirelessly by an RFID reader. The RFID tags can be passive (powered by the RFID reader's signal) or active (have their own power source).
